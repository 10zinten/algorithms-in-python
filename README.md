# Algorithm Implementations

This is just a collection of algorithms I wanted to implement in order to improve my understanding. They are NOT optimized and probably shouldn't be used in production code.

Here is the complete list ::

## DP 

## Geometry

## Trees

## Union_find

## String

## Recursion

## Sorting and Basics

## Arrays

## Graphs

## Testing 

## Heaps 

## CP 

## Data-Structures

## Lists

## Miscellaneous
